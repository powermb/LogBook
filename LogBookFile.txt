	Main findings:
	-PM2.5 is associated with prevalent symptoms - stronger assoc with shorter lags
	-Coarse fraction is null, PM10 is halfway in between PM2.5 and Coarse
	-DTR, some suggestive assoc, but poor dose response/consistency across different metrics
	-Little evidence of EMM except perhaps by region
	-Sensitivity analyses are consistent with main analyses - stronger effects for 88-03 PM2.5 in non-movers
	Suggested to do list:
	-Alternate DTR categories (100m, 300m cut-offs)
	-Splines to look for non-linearity
	-Closer look at EMM by region
	-Double check % close code to see if reverse coded? (right now close = fewer symptoms)
	-IPW
	-New sensitivity - exlcude "cases" in 1988
Reviewed output of CCI_IncAnalyses_2013_0426.sas and associated R code
	-DTR is null
	-Splines indicate linear is fine, still null
	-Alternate case definition (include those on meds as case), excluding B-S index, new covar list
		doesn't change anything - still null for main analyses
	-Looking at MSA vs non-MSA - do see an assoc with PM2.5 and incident "cases" in those not in an MSA
		-Very small N
		-Direction of covars is similar, but some big swings
		-?Outlier driven
	-Need to look more closesly at EMM by region, htn, age - LRT?
