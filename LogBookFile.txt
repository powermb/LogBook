PM_PSYCH PROJECT
Reviewed output of CCI_PrevAnalysis_2013_0426.sas
	Main findings:
	-PM2.5 is associated with prevalent symptoms - stronger assoc with shorter lags
	-Coarse fraction is null, PM10 is halfway in between PM2.5 and Coarse
	-DTR, some suggestive assoc, but poor dose response/consistency across different metrics
	-Little evidence of EMM except perhaps by region
	-Sensitivity analyses are consistent with main analyses - stronger effects for 88-03 PM2.5 in non-movers
	Suggested to do list:
	-Alternate DTR categories (100m, 300m cut-offs)
	-Splines to look for non-linearity
	-Closer look at EMM by region
	-Double check % close code to see if reverse coded? (right now close = fewer symptoms)
	-IPW
	-New sensitivity - exlcude "cases" in 1988
Reviewed output of CCI_IncAnalyses_2013_0426.sas and associated R code
	-DTR is null
	-Splines indicate linear is fine, still null
	-Alternate case definition (include those on meds as case), excluding B-S index, new covar list
		doesn't change anything - still null for main analyses
	-Looking at MSA vs non-MSA - do see an assoc with PM2.5 and incident "cases" in those not in an MSA
		-Very small N
		-Direction of covars is similar, but some big swings
		-?Outlier driven
	-Need to look more closesly at EMM by region, htn, age - LRT?

PM-PSYCH PROJECT
	Met with Mariathi about IPW weights
	Met with Marc
		-Called Inc analysis done, with exception of applying IPW and double checking EMM
		-Agreed with proposed follow-ups for prev analysis:  
		check percclose code, alt DTR categories, drop med income, splines, sens excluding cases
		in 1988, IPW, closer look at EMM

2013.05.22
PM-PSYCH
	Finished review of Marianthi's code (baseDataset only)
	Analytical decisions about IPW process and rationale:
		-14% of questionnaires completed were the short form questionnaire, with about 11% for each year. 
		-The pattern does not seem to be such that people do long, then short, then drop out/die according to visual 				inspection of the data.  Often times we'll get a short form questionnaire in the middle of otherwise consistent 				follow-up. 
		-This is supported by further exploration.  If we restrict to the last observation per person where they did 				complete a questionnaire, 21% of them were short questionnaires.  Only 3% of persons completed a short 	questionnaire 		only as their last questionnaire.   ~40% of persons completed a short questionnaire prior to their last one. 		However, completing the short form questionnaire in 2002 does predict if they have a CCI in 2004.  Looks like short 		form questionnaire completion does predict subsequent drop out, but it is far from deterministic. 

		1.  Keep them as not censored after 1988-2002 as long as they complete a questionnaire (either long or short) the 		following year (i.e. if irt02 ne . then censored00 = 0). 
		2.  Consider them censored after 2002 if they do not complete the CCI in 2004, even if they complete other parts 		of the questionnaire and have a valid irt date.
		3.  Consider them dead, not censored, if they died before 2004. 
		4.  Given that short form questionnaire completion does predict drop out, let's add it as a time-varying variable 		to our logistic regression models 
PB-COG
	Finalized almost all manuscript documents for submission, including creation of Appendix B
	Uploaded everything to submission website for Environmental Research
	Waiting on final "OK" on highlights to submit

PB-COG
	Finalized highlights, submitted to Environmental Research
PB-MORTALITY
	Met with Marc
	To-do list:
1.  Mindy will check the weight programs.
2.  Marc will then create a file that does the following analyses:
-All analyses in white only, same Pb exposure categories, Andersen-Gill counting structure, adjusted for covariates and age at XRF
-6 models:
(a) full dataset
(b) restricted to <45 at baseline 
(c) full dataset with IPW for loss to follow-up up to point of XRF
(d) full dataset with IPW for both death and loss to follow-up
(e) restriced to <45 dataset with IPW for loss to follow-up up to point of XRF
(f) restricted to <45 dataset with IPW for both death and loss to follow-up
3.  At some point we should do a lit review of the literature on left truncation/left censoring and look up all the refs on right censoring from Howe et al. 

PM-PSYCH
	Met with Marianthi about IPW weights, followed up with Marc
	we're going to do the following approach:

1.  Try ignoring the death/censoring distinction.  Take anyone who skipped 2 questionnaires in a row and consider them censored at the time of their last completed questionnaire.  See if the model fits pretty well.  Hopefully it does and we consider this the "weighted for drop out for any reason including death" option.

2.  Delete anyone who died before 2004 from the dataset.  Predict drop-out only (again, defining anyone who skipped 2 questionnaires in a row as censored at the time of their last completed questionnaire.  This is the "RCT interpretation" option.

I'm around almost all day tomorrow if you need to talk through this.  617 721 9984.  

To summarize our other decisions:

1.  Use PM2.5 and coarse as the exposure variables
2.  For all models, drop visit, keep age (try categorical, and then, if it makes sense some continuous or continuous+squared term), drop age at menopause, weight, race.  Always force in age, PM and education.
3. Process: Try making a "full model" then try adding age*health outcomes or smoking variables - keep the ones that seem useful.  Follow that by coming up with an analyst motivated parsimonious/defensible model that hopefully works across datasets.
4.  Get a table of # years between year of death and year of last quesitonnaire.
5.  Get a list of people who are considered "censored" according to the skip 2 questionnaire rule but who complete a CCI in 2004.

	Debugged MHI_Dataprep_2013_0514 and MHI_Analyses_2013_0514
	Met with Marc
		-Check median of quintiles to decide how to do trend test
		-Check existing literature to figure out for what PM increment to report effects in
		-Report effects in %change in count score per unit increase in PM
		-Check spline - is there a test for "is it non-linear"
		-Try restricting to those who return quex in June
		-Correlations across lags
		-Add movers sensitivity for 2003 and lags
		-Check case exclusion - is it 1988?
		-Think about how to evaluate if restricting to non-movers produces bias
		-Create large tables:  Table 1 = covars and DTR, Table 2 = exposure dist for PM, Table3 = linear PM, unadj, adj1, adj2, Table 4 = quintiles PM adj 1 only, Table 5 = DTR unadj, adj1 adj2, Table 6 = PM correlations, Table 7 = Sensitivity analyses PM, Table 8 = how covars vary by quintiles of PM (choose most important lag/type of PM)
		-Create streamlined paper focusing on lag of interest, play up public health burden and how other papers suck

COMMENCEMENT

2013.06.03
PM-PSYCH
	Met with Marianthi to discuss IPW weights -> mostly make sense, but H-L is problematic..?missingness
	Decided to look at more fine-grained c-table to look for potential positivity issue
	Decided to reassign <5% missingness to the largest category
	Recoded splines
PB-MORT
	Reviewed Marc's code on IPW weights and provided following comments:
	1.  The second stepwise model has a likelihood error - what did you do to get around this?
	2.  Why are you forcing in the hypertension variables?
	3.  The c-table for the dead model indicates you might have a positivity problem.
	4.  The H-L test is significant for the other model - this is also bad.
	You can also see the potential positivity problem when you compare the proc means from all the visits and for the 613 persons you have in your analytical dataset.  The range for those in your analytical dataset is MUCH smaller than for all the visits.  You aren't getting the full range of people available to you.
